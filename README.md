Welcome to Epic Military Shooter (README)!
=================================================

This game is about shooting the "bad guys".
The goal is to reach 100 points in the least time you can and missing the least shots.
The enemies will appear on the screen and you shoot them by clicking on them.

The point system works like this:
1. You get 1 point if you hit the body.
2. You get 2 points if you hit the head.
3. (Arm counts as miss because that is non lethal.)

I think this all you need to know, Good Luck, Have Fun!

Thoughts about the project
==========================

I myself actually enjoyed this project a lot. Mostly because I want to work in game 
development in the future, so it came handy. Most likely I won't work with Java in game
development, but some kind of "developer mindset" was build in me at least. 

Also based on the feedback on the game from friends and family the game is good, so I 
guess I reached my goal.
